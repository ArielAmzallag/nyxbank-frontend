A dystopian banking interface built with Next.js, featuring cyberpunk aesthetics, glitch animations, and a dark financial narrative.

## Overview

NyxBank's frontend simulates a futuristic banking system where cryptocurrency, biometric collateral, and AI assistants are commonplace. The UI features neon accents, glassmorphism, and subtle glitch effects to create an unsettling cyberpunk atmosphere.

## Features

- **Cyberpunk UI**: Glassmorphism cards, neon text effects, and glitch animations
- **Banking Dashboard**: View balances across multiple cryptocurrencies
- **Transaction System**: Send money, view history, and exchange currencies
- **R.E.M. AI Assistant**: Chat with an AI that occasionally reveals disturbing information
- **User Profiles**: Manage account settings and biometric collateral
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional on mobile and desktop devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nyxbank.git
   cd nyxbank/nyxbank-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Demo Mode

The application includes a demo mode that allows you to toggle between logged-in and logged-out states without implementing a full authentication system:

1. When running in development mode, look for the small emoji button (ðŸ‘¤/ðŸ‘¥) next to the NyxBank logo
2. Click this button to toggle between logged-in and logged-out states
3. The navbar will update to show the appropriate navigation options

This makes it easy to test both states of the application during development.

## Hidden Features

The application contains several hidden features and easter eggs that hint at the dystopian narrative:

- Glitched messages in the AI assistant
- Redacted transactions in the transaction history
- References to biometric collateral and debt enforcement
- The mysterious "Damnatio Memoriae" protocol (accessible at `/damnatio-memoriae` with the access code `ADMIN-DAMNATIO-9382`)
